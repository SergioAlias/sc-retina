# Analysis of single-cell retina data

This repository contains some code for the analysis of single-cell data of human and mouse retina

## Files description

- `annotate_cell_types.R`: R script for adding manual cell type annotation to an already saved [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) object

- `avg_expression_genes_200_more.R`: R script for getting the top 200 more expressed genes, considering only genes expressed in at least 50% of cells

- `change_genes_mouse_to_human_gene_celltypes.R`: Script for converting mouse genes to human genes in the files generated by `avg_expression_genes_200_more.R` and `DEgenes_mouse_WT_mutant.R`

- `change_genes_mouse_to_human_norm_counts.R`: Script for converting mouse genes to human genes in the normalized counts file generated by `norm_counts_n_genes.R`

- `cluster-celltypes`: TSV file containing manually annotated clusters for human data

- `cluster-celltypes-mouse`: TSV file containing manually annotated clusters for mouse data

- `DEgenes_human_early_late.R`: R script for calculating DE genes between early and late PCW samples of the human dataset

- `DEgenes_mouse_WT_mutant.R`: R script for calculating DE genes between WT and mutant samples of the mouse dataset

- `human_preprocessing.R`: R script for preprocessing human retina single-cell data according to a publication

- `mouse_preprocessing.R`: R script for preprocessing mouse retina single-cell data according to a publication

- `norm_counts_n_genes.R`: R script for generating normalized tables of gene counts per sample and number of cells expressing each gene per sample

- `report_meeting_human.Rmd`: R Markdown template for generating a HTML report with all the analysis of the human data

- `report_meeting_mouse.Rmd`: R Markdown template for generating a HTML report with all the analysis of the mouse data
